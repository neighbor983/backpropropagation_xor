# backpropropagation_xor


In this assignment you will design and train a backpropagation network to learn the exclusive-OR function.  

1.	Use one hidden layer with 4 hidden units. Plot the error as a function of the number of iterations. Remember the initial weights.
2.	Verify that momentum term indeed improves convergence (Î¼ = 0.5). Use the initial weights remembered in (1).
3.	Repeat (1) using bipolar sigmoid and bipolar representation for exclusive-OR function. The network should converge faster. 
4.	Verify that Nguyen-Widrow approach of assigning initial weights improves convergence. 
5.	Use two hidden layers (3 units in the first hidden layer and 2 units in the second hidden layer).
